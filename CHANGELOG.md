## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Code review follow-up (2026-05-05):** Removed UTF-8 BOM from `src/index.js` package entry point.
- **Process lifecycle hardening (2026-05-05):** Added `.unref()` to status-reset timers in `modbus-in`/`modbus-out`, the safety timeout in `modbus-server-config.stopServer()`, and the drain-wait timer in `RtuSemaphore.drain()` so they no longer hold the Node.js event loop open during shutdown.
- **Finalization audit (2026-05-05):** Restored runnable validation by adding an ESLint configuration and automatic TLS certificate fixture generation before test commands.
- **Client node lifecycle:** Added on-demand connected transport creation for read, write, and discover nodes so deployed flows can establish connections without manually seeding `_transport`.
- **Node status transitions:** Added status reset cleanup for `modbus-read` success states and all `modbus-out` validation error paths.
- **Transport error safety:** Guarded transport `error` event emission when no listeners are registered to avoid unhandled EventEmitter crashes during connection failures.
- **Editor UI helpers:** Fixed address hint parsing to preserve valid zero addresses and avoid `parseInt(x) || 0` edge cases.

### Changed
- **Certificate fixtures:** `test/fixtures/certs/generate-certs.js` now prefers OpenSSL generation with a pure-JS fallback, making TLS tests deterministic while keeping generated PEM files out of source control.
- **Validation:** `npm run lint` now runs cleanly, `npm test` regenerates required cert fixtures automatically, and `npm pack --dry-run` validates the package contents.

## [0.1.0] – 2026-04-17

### Added
- **FC 22 – Mask Write Register (WP 6.1)** – Atomic AND/OR bitmask operation on a single holding register. Extended `modbus-write` node with FC 22 support including validation, transport method, and UI.
- **FC 23 – Read/Write Multiple Registers (WP 6.1)** – Combined write + read in a single PDU. Extended `modbus-write` node with FC 23 support including `readAddress`/`readQuantity` config fields, conditional UI visibility, and `buildReadWritePayload()` in payload builder.
- **FC 43/14 – Read Device Identification (WP 6.2)** – New `modbus-discover` node for MEI Transport. Supports Basic/Regular/Extended/Individual identification levels, dynamic overrides via `msg.deviceIdCode`/`msg.objectId`, and vendor-specific object ID mapping.
- **Extended Transport Layer** – Added `maskWriteRegister()`, `readWriteRegisters()`, `readDeviceIdentification()`, and `_validateMask()` to `base-transport.js`. Added `MAX_FC23_WRITE_REGISTERS: 121` to `MODBUS_LIMITS`.
- **Extended Payload Builder** – Added `buildReadWritePayload()` (FC 23) and `buildDiscoverPayload()` (FC 43/14) to `payload-builder.js`. Added FC_NAMES entries for FC 22, 23, 43.
- **MS-9 Tests** – 81 new tests: 45 unit tests (transport validation, payload builder), 22 FC 22/23 integration tests, 14 FC 43/14 integration tests. Total: 646/646 passing.
- **Node Registration** – Added `modbus-discover` to `package.json` `node-red.nodes` section.

- **Lifecycle / Leak Tests (WP 5.2)** – 29 integration tests in `test/integration/lifecycle.test.js` validating:
  - Close-handler cleanup for all 6 node types (poll timers, queues, transports, event listeners, caches, pending requests)
  - Partial deploy scenarios (remove one node, keep others)
  - Full flow re-deploy with resource verification
  - Rapid successive deploys (5× client, 5× server) without leaks
  - EventEmitter listener count verification after re-deploy (no accumulation)
  - Memory RSS sanity check (< 30 MB growth over 10 deploy cycles)
  - Edge cases: null timer, null queue, null transport, empty status timers, missing server config, active deferred timer

- **Example Flows (WP 5.3)** – 3 importable example flows in `examples/flows/`:
  - `watchdog-heartbeat.json` – Watchdog heartbeat pattern with toggling register and timeout detection
  - `rbe-filter.json` – Report-By-Exception filter with configurable deadband for efficient data logging
  - `bitwise-coil-packing.json` – Pack 16 coils into a single register and unpack status registers into named bit flags

- **npm Publish Configuration** – Added `"files"` array to `package.json` limiting the published package to `src/`, `examples/`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` (42 files, 63 kB packed)

- **README.md Finalization (WP 5.4)** – Complete Node Reference section documenting all 6 node types with property tables, I/O descriptions, and payload formats. Enhanced Quick Start with output example. Example flows section with import instructions.

- **Node-RED Help Sidebar Texts** – Comprehensive help documentation for all 6 nodes:
  - `modbus-client-config`: TCP/RTU settings, TLS/mTLS configuration, connection lifecycle, credential handling
  - `modbus-server-config`: Dynamic Server Proxy architecture, cache configuration, TLS, status indicators
  - `modbus-read`: FC 01–04 table, address mode, poll interval, full output payload fields, error behavior
  - `modbus-write`: FC 05/06/15/16 input formats, backpressure queue, drop strategies, status indicators
  - `modbus-in`: Request structure (read/write), requestId lifecycle, FC/unit ID filtering, example flow
  - `modbus-out`: Success/error response format, Modbus exception code table (0x01–0x0B), timeout behavior
  - All nodes now include: status indicator tables, error behavior sections, and Modbus specification references

### Fixed (Code Review Pass)
- **Code Review #6 – 4 bugs fixed (2026-04-18):**
  - `src/nodes/client/modbus-write.js`: Replaced `parseInt(x, 10) || default` with `parseIntSafe(x, default)` for all config fields (`fc`, `address`, `queueMaxSize`, `readAddress`, `readQuantity`). The previous pattern incorrectly coerced `0` to the default value, causing broadcast unit ID and zero-address configurations to silently use defaults. (Category D – DRY/consistency)
  - `src/nodes/client/modbus-discover.js`: Replaced `parseInt(x, 10) || default` with `parseIntSafe()` for both config fields (`deviceIdCode`, `objectId`) and dynamic `msg.deviceIdCode` / `msg.objectId` overrides, ensuring consistent fallback to the node's configured value when an invalid override is supplied. (Category D – DRY/consistency)
  - `src/nodes/client/modbus-write.js` (FC 23 branch): Added explicit null/shape guard on the `readWriteRegisters` transport response (`!result || !Array.isArray(result.data)` throws a descriptive error) to prevent `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'data')` if the transport returns a malformed or empty response. (Category B – Robustness)
  - `src/lib/parser/buffer-parser.js`: Strengthened `_validateRegisterPair()` to validate that each register value is a finite integer within the 16-bit unsigned range `[0, 65535]`. Previously only the `typeof === 'number'` check was performed, allowing `NaN`, `Infinity`, negative values, and out-of-range floats to silently pass through to `Buffer` writes where they would produce undefined output. `TypeError` is retained for non-number inputs; `RangeError` is thrown for out-of-range values. (Category A/B – Input validation)

### Fixed (Previous Code Review Passes)
- **modbus-server-config:** Added `setCoilArray` (FC 15) and `setRegisterArray` (FC 16) to the modbus-serial vector so multi-write requests are proxied as a single `modbusRequest` event with the full array payload, and cache invalidation receives the correct `count`. Previously FC 15/16 fell back to per-address loops.
- **state-machine/guards:** `isValidRequest` now enforces `address ≤ 0xFFFF` (upper bound) and requires an integer `length` between 1 and 2000; it also rejects empty `operation` strings. Prevents malformed requests from reaching the transport.
- **state-machine/connection-machine:** `createConnectionActor` now normalizes `baseDelay`, `maxDelay`, `maxRetries`, and `maxQueueSize`. If `baseDelay > maxDelay`, the values are swapped to preserve meaningful exponential backoff.
- **tcp-transport:** `connect()` now destroys the TLS wrapper when `connectTCP` fails, preventing a leaked `TlsWrapper` instance on reconnect attempts.
- **rtu-semaphore:** The inter-frame timer is now tracked as `_scheduleTimer` and cleared in `drain()`, allowing clean shutdown without a dangling pending timer.
- **modbus-read:** `pollInterval` is now clamped to `(0, 86400000]`. Negative or non-finite values (previously accepted by `parseInt`) are rejected with a warning and polling is disabled. Switched to `parseIntSafe` for all numeric config parsing to correctly handle `0`.

### Changed
- **Code Review #5: State Machine, Cache & Transport Hardening**
  - Fix `connection-machine.js` reconnect retry reset: `reconnecting → connected` transition now calls `resetRetry` so subsequent failures get a fresh retry budget instead of continuing from where the last reconnect left off
  - Fix `guards.js` NaN address rejection: `isValidRequest` now uses `Number.isFinite()` to reject NaN addresses (previously `NaN` passed `typeof === 'number'` and `NaN < 0 === false`)
  - Fix `register-cache.js` range invalidation: `invalidateOnWrite()` now scans for cached range reads that overlap the written address range, preventing stale data when a write hits the middle of a previously cached batch read
  - Add disconnect timeout in `base-transport.js`: `disconnect()` now has a 10s safety timeout preventing hung promises if `_client.close()` callback never fires
  - Add `timer.unref()` to `modbus-read.js` poll interval timer and `modbus-server-config.js` deferred start timer
  - Fix `certificate-validator.js` CRLF handling: `_parseOURoles()` now splits on `/\r?\n/` to handle Windows-style line endings in X.509 subjects

### Changed
- **Code Review #4: Security, Robustness & Code Quality**
  - Fix double `done()` call in `modbus-write.js` LIFO drop: drop event handler now only calls `done()` for FIFO drops (old items). LIFO drops are handled by the current input handler, preventing Node-RED message tracking corruption
  - Fix `tls-wrapper.js` `disconnect()` double-resolve: added `settled` guard and `clearTimeout` to prevent timeout from firing after socket close event, eliminating redundant `socket.destroy()` on already-closed sockets
  - Fix `base-transport.js` `destroy()` resource leak: wrap `disconnect()` call in try/catch so `removeAllListeners()` always runs even if disconnect throws, preventing listener accumulation
  - Fix `modbus-in.js` and `modbus-out.js` timer leak: track `setTimeout` handles for status-reset and clear them on node close, preventing "not a function" errors after node removal
  - Add timeout protection to `modbus-server-config.js` `stopServer()`: 10s safety timer ensures the promise resolves even if `server.close()` callback never fires; try/catch around close calls prevents unhandled exceptions during shutdown
  - Extract shared `parseIntSafe()` utility to `src/lib/utils.js` (DRY): remove duplicate implementations from `modbus-client-config.js` and `modbus-server-config.js`
  - Add polling error throttle in `modbus-read.js`: repeated identical errors during interval polling are logged only once, preventing log flooding when transport is down
  - Add `timer.unref()` to `rtu-semaphore.js` inter-frame delay timer: prevents the timer from keeping the Node.js process alive during shutdown
  - Generate missing test certificate fixtures (`test/fixtures/certs/`): CA, server (with SAN), client (with OU=ModbusOperator), encrypted key (AES-256), untrusted cert, expired cert – via `generate-certs.js` script. Fixes 35 previously failing security tests (532/532 now passing)

### Added

Supports encrypted private keys with passphrase. Used by both client and server config nodes.
  - `src/lib/security/tls-wrapper.js` – TLS socket factory for Modbus/TCP Security connections. Creates and manages TLS sockets compliant with the Modbus/TCP Security specification (port 802, TLS 1.2/1.3, mTLS with X.509v3). Pre-validates certificates, supports handshake timeout, emits connect/error/close events. Peer certificate inspection and RBAC role extraction from connected peers.
  - Extended `src/lib/transport/tcp-transport.js` – TLS support via `tls: true` config option. When TLS enabled: creates TlsWrapper, establishes TLS connection, passes secure socket to modbus-serial's connectTCP. Auto-sets port to 802 when TLS enabled and port not explicitly set. Reports transport type as `tcp+tls`. TLS resource cleanup on destroy.
  - Extended `src/nodes/config/modbus-client-config.js` – TLS configuration for client connections: tlsEnabled flag, rejectUnauthorized toggle, credential fields for CA/cert/key paths and passphrase via Node-RED Credential Store. Validates TLS credentials on startup with warnings and errors. TLS config merged into transport config.
  - Extended `src/nodes/config/modbus-client-config.html` – TLS UI section: Enable TLS checkbox (auto-switches port 502↔802), CA Certificate path, Client Certificate path, Private Key path, Key Passphrase, Verify Server checkbox. Dynamic show/hide based on connection type and TLS toggle. Help sidebar with Modbus/TCP Security documentation.
  - Extended `src/nodes/config/modbus-server-config.js` – TLS listener support: creates `tls.createServer()` when TLS enabled, passes to ServerTCP via server option. Supports mTLS with requestCert/rejectUnauthorized. Credential fields for server CA/cert/key/passphrase. Validates certificates on startup.
  - Extended `src/nodes/config/modbus-server-config.html` – TLS UI section: Enable TLS checkbox, Server CA/Certificate/Key/Passphrase fields, Verify Clients checkbox. Help sidebar with TLS documentation and security notes.

  - `test/unit/security/tls-wrapper.test.js` – 40 unit tests covering constructor (host validation, defaults, options), TLS options building, connection state, disconnect/destroy lifecycle, integration tests with real TLS server (mTLS handshake, peer certificate inspection, untrusted cert rejection), error scenarios (connection refused, handshake timeout).
  - `test/fixtures/certs/` – Self-signed test certificates: CA (root), server (with SAN), client (with OU=ModbusOperator for RBAC), encrypted key (AES-256), untrusted cert (not signed by CA), expired cert (1-day validity). All documented in fixtures/README.md.

### Added
- **MS-6: Server Caching & Optimization**
  - `src/lib/cache/register-cache.js` – In-memory hashmap-based register cache for the Modbus server proxy. Stores read responses keyed by function code, unit ID, and address. Features configurable TTL per entry (default 60s), max cache size with LRU-like eviction of oldest entries, automatic invalidation on write operations (FC 05/06/15/16 invalidate corresponding FC 01/03 entries), periodic expired-entry cleanup, runtime enable/disable, unit-level invalidation, and performance statistics (hit rate, size). Extends EventEmitter with hit/miss/evict events.
  - `test/unit/cache/register-cache.test.js` – 71 unit tests covering constructor validation, get/set operations, TTL expiration, max size eviction, write invalidation (FC 05→FC 01, FC 06→FC 03, FC 15→FC 01, FC 16→FC 03), unit invalidation, clear, enable/disable toggling, events, statistics, destroy lifecycle, and edge cases (address 0, unit 255, large arrays, constant memory under flooding)
  - Integrated cache into `modbus-server-config.js` – Read requests check cache first (cache hit returns immediately without flow traversal), write requests auto-invalidate affected cache entries, successful flow responses are cached for subsequent reads
  - Extended `modbus-server-config.html` – Added cache configuration UI: Enable Cache checkbox, Cache TTL (ms), Max Cache Size, with dynamic show/hide of cache fields and help sidebar documentation

  - Registered `modbus-server-config`, `modbus-in`, `modbus-out` nodes in package.json `node-red.nodes`

### Changed
- **Code Review #3: Robustness & Correctness Improvements**
  - Fix resource leak: FIFO drop handler in `modbus-write.js` now calls `done()` on dropped messages to release Node-RED message tracking resources
  - Fix double `processQueue()` call on write error: replace `.catch().then()` chain with `.then(onSuccess, onError)` pattern to prevent redundant queue processing
  - Remove dead code: unreachable `value === true` / `value === false` branches in FC 05 `validateValue()` (already handled by prior `typeof === 'boolean'` check)
  - Simplify `doWrite()`: remove redundant `if/else` branching for FC 5/6 vs FC 15/16 – all function codes use the same `transport[method](address, value)` call
  - Add clarifying comment in `connection-machine.js` explaining that `writing.SUCCESS` → `reading` transition is intentional (consumer-driven dispatch)

  - Registered `modbus-read` node in package.json `node-red.nodes`

### Changed
- **Code Review #2: Quality & Correctness Improvements**
  - Fix `package.json`: remove ghost `modbus-read` node entry pointing to non-existent file – would crash Node-RED on load
  - Fix `package.json`: replace German placeholders `[HIER AUTOR EINTRAGEN]` and `[HIER-OWNER]` with actual values
  - Fix `.mocharc.yml`: remove invalid `spec-version` key (not a valid mocha config property)
  - Fix HTML help text: correct "Unit ID (1-247)" to "Unit ID (0-255)" to match `BaseTransport.setID()` validation
  - Refactor `connection-machine.js`: replace inline anonymous functions in `error` and `backoff` state entries with XState v5 parameterized `notifyStatus` action using resolver functions

  - Add `setID()` range validation (unit ID 0-255) per Modbus specification
  - Fix `disconnect()` – properly await `close()` callback via Promise instead of fire-and-forget pattern
  - Fix `storeError` action – remove XState v4 `event.data` fallback, use v5-correct `event.error`
  - Add ±25% jitter to exponential backoff to prevent thundering-herd reconnection storms
  - Add `canEnqueue` guard combining `isValidRequest` + `isQueueNotFull` – prevents unbounded queue growth in reading/writing states
  - Replace dead `self.system.emit()` notification actions with functional `onStatusChange` callback pattern
  - Fix `RtuSemaphore.drain()` – replace `setTimeout` polling loop with event-based waiting (complete/timeout/error)
  - Fix `modbus-client-config.js` – replace `parseInt(x) || default` with `parseIntSafe()` to correctly handle value 0 (e.g. unitId 0 for TCP broadcast)
